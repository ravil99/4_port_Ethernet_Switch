# 4_port_Ethernet_Switch
This project was made by me and my colleague Ilya Chaschin in summer 2019
This is a working protorype of 4-port Ethernet switch
Our project uses 8-bit GMII interface and was tested on clock of 125 MHz. So it works without major error on 1Gb/s speed.
FPGA design was tested on MD1-1RU communication system (made by Micran company from Tomsk) which contained Altera Cyclone 5 5CGXBC7C6F23C7 SoC.

Software used in this project:
- Quartus 2 15.0 Web Edition
- ModelSim 10.3 D
- Visual Studio Code
